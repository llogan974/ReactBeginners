/*
Props

Concepts: Prop and State
Props are like HTML attributes.
Like Img, that needs the src and "alt" attributes

Components call them "props" not attributes, and they are HOW WE GET DATA INTO A COMPONENT

Data lives in the app, and we must get it into our header component.

State is where data lives.
Props is how the data gets where it needs to be displayed.

Props are like the data object that got passed in; kinda like an argument that got passed into a function

In the concole in React, type $r and it will show you all the info about a component
