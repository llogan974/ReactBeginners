/*
When you go to the app, we want to render the store picker.

When you visit the store, the url should change.

Also need to create a 404

React router: it is not built in. There are a few out there:
next.js, and reactrouter

Make a router compoenent, and a stateless router component.

Router will be pulling in all of our data, so all we need to render on the page is the router
