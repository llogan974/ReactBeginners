    <p>Hi, my name is Sarah Schoultz and I am the Admissions Counselor for the Piedmont Triad! I am originally from Upstate New York and graduated from S.U.N.Y Fredonia. I moved to North Carolina after graduation and have lived in Greensboro ever since! I have previously worked as an Admissions Counselor for an international boarding school in Greensboro and have also worked within the public school system for many years. My husband and I started our own small business in 2014 and successfully sold it in 2016. I made my way to High Point University in 2019 after hearing about so many of the wonderful things the University has to offer and I knew I wanted to be a part of it!  I teach Group Fitness classes on the side and am involved with my synagogue, Temple Emanuel in Greensboro. I am married and have 2 wonderful children. Iâ€™m excited to be a part of High Point University and look forward to helping you make the most of your time on campus. I'm looking forward to working with lots of great local students & their families, and hope to welcome you to HPU soon! </p>
